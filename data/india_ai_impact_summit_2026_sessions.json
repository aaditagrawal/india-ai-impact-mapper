While many factors contribute to this challenge, three stand out consistently: lack of industry‑relevant skills, limited awareness of emerging opportunities, and absence of structured career guidance. For fringe and underserved communities—rural youth, women, differently abled individuals—these barriers are magnified by geography, socio‑economic constraints, and access gaps. If India's AI journey is to be sustainable and inclusive, talent cannot come from a narrow segment of society. Inclusion is not charity—it is a national necessity.",

      "description": "The ability of countries, regions, and alliances to thrive amid geopolitical volatility and systemic shocks depends on aligning three domains: AI and strategic technologies, diversified low-carbon energy systems, and modernised security capabilities. Rather than advancing in isolation, these pillars must progress together, at speed and scale, to strengthen economic and societal resilience. This discussion explores the \"triple transition,\" outlining practical pathways to navigate it while promoting cooperation, accountability, and public trust globally.",

Aligned with the objectives of Atmanirbhar Bharat and Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) compliance, this session examines the emerging architecture of sovereign compute ecosystems, including edge–cloud convergence for next-generation (6G) networks, neuromorphic computing, and low-precision inference systems designed for scalable deployment. It further explores multi-agent orchestration frameworks and cross-sector compute-exchange models that can expand access to high-performance computing for startups, academia, and public institutions. Such an approach aims to democratise advanced computational resources while strengthening India's long-term digital sovereignty, innovation capacity, and research acceleration.",

      "description": "AI workloads are driving explosive growth in data center power density—racks now routinely hit 100+ kW (vs. traditional 10–20 kW), with megawatt-scale clusters and facilities demanding hundreds of MW. Power demand from global data centers is projected to rise 50–165% by 2030, largely due to AI. The AI era is forcing a fundamental redesign—native HVDC distribution + liquid cooling will make high-density, sustainable AI infrastructure possible at scale, dramatically cutting losses, material use, and operational costs compared to legacy designs. The transition is already underway among hyperscalers and will become standard within 3–5 years. Velankani Group is a leader in making Indigenous AI Data Center Infrastructure which will cater the demand for the Future.",
