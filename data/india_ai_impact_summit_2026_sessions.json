      "description": "As digital technologies become central to education, linguistic accessibility emerges as a critical equity issue. This study examines how universities enable multilingual participation through UA. Drawing on Diffusion Innovation Theory (DIT) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this investigation reviews stakeholder experiences across universities in Asia and Europe using an innovative AI-assisted interview methodology. The findings also revealed critical gaps in universities' capacity to advance UN SDG 4/9/10/17 through inclusive digital infrastructure while presenting billions of dollars opportunity.",

      "description": "AI systems deployed across diverse cultural contexts often fail not because of technical limitations, but because they overlook social norms—the unwritten rules that shape human behaviour and decision-making. A recommendation system that succeeds in the United States may not resonate in India. A health chatbot that effectively engages American users may alienate Indian communities if it does not reflect local expectations and communication styles. This research-focused session convenes leading scholarship and applied work examining how culturally grounded design, local data partnerships, and participatory methods can improve AI performance across contexts. The emphasis is on embedding social understanding into model development to ensure effectiveness, legitimacy, and equitable impact across geographies.",

DPI conversations center on digital identity, digital payment, data exchange. AI-DPI convergence can create exponential value and new risk categories. While this convergence accelerates, critical questions remain: How can DPI lower barriers for local AI innovation while preventing new forms of exclusion? How can responsible AI systems be built in resource-constrained environments using DPI approaches?",

Yet biased datasets, exclusionary design choices, and uneven deployment risk reinforcing inequities and disproportionately harming already marginalised communities, including the elderly, persons with disabilities, and rural populations. This interdisciplinary panel will explore inclusive AI strategies, such as participatory design, representative data practices, and context-sensitive governance frameworks, to ensure that AI systems in healthcare are designed, developed, and deployed in ways that mitigate unintended harm. The focus is on building equitable digital health ecosystems that proactively address structural disparities rather than amplify them.",

The transition is already underway among hyperscalers and will become standard within 3–5 years.\n\nVelankani Group is a leader in making Indigenous AI Data Center Infrastructure which will cater the demand for the Future.",
